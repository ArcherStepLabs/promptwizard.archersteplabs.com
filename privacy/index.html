<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 14 January 2026</p>

<h2>Who we are</h2>
<p>Prompt Wizard is provided by P Nguyen, trading as Archer Step Labs (“we”, “us”).</p>
<p>If you need to contact us, email: <a href="mailto:promptwizard@archersteplabs.com">promptwizard@archersteplabs.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Prompt Wizard edits text you copy by opening the Editor in the foreground.</li>
	<li>We do not run servers that store your text.</li>
	<li>We do not upload your clipboard or Memory Boxes.</li>
	<li>We do not use third-party analytics or advertising SDKs at this time.</li>
	<li>Core editing features work offline. Some features (for example, purchase verification) may require an internet connection.</li>
	<li>You control what you store and can delete it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What data Prompt Wizard processes</h2>
<p>Prompt Wizard can process text you place on your device clipboard and text you type into the app.</p>

<h3>Clipboard access (foreground only)</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Read:</strong> We read clipboard text only when you open the Editor while the app is in the foreground.</li>
	<li><strong>Write:</strong> When you exit the Editor, the app may write the Editor text back to the clipboard. It will not write to the clipboard if:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>blocked mode is active (e.g., free limit reached), or</li>
	<li>the final text is the same as the baseline text captured when the Editor opened, or</li>
	<li>the final text is empty.</li>
</ul>

<h3>No background clipboard activity</h3>
<p>Prompt Wizard does not read your clipboard in the background and does not run background clipboard scraping.</p>

<h3>No auto-paste</h3>
<p>Prompt Wizard does not automatically paste text into other apps. You paste manually.</p>

<h3>Memory Boxes (local storage)</h3>
<p>If you save text into Memory Boxes, it is stored locally on your device. Implementation details may vary by version, but storage remains on-device.</p>

<h2>Permissions and device access</h2>
<p>Prompt Wizard is designed to minimize access to device data and sensitive device features.</p>
<p>The app is designed to avoid requesting access to sensitive device features such as location, contacts, microphone, or camera. We will update this policy if this changes.</p>
<p>Clipboard access occurs only as described above, while the Editor is open in the foreground.</p>

<h2>What data we collect</h2>
<p>Prompt Wizard does not require an account.</p>
<p>We collect personal data only if you contact support:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If you email us, we receive your email address and whatever you write in the message.</li>
	<li>The app may prefill app version in the email subject/body to help support.</li>
	<li>The app does not automatically attach clipboard content or Memory Box content to support emails.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Exporting data</h2>
<p>If you choose to export, Prompt Wizard exports data on-device (method may vary by Android version) and then opens Android’s share options.</p>
<ul>
	<li>You choose where to share/export. We do not upload your export to a server.</li>
	<li>You are responsible for where you export/share content and for securing it after you share it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Purchases</h2>
<p>If you buy Pro, payments are processed by Google Play. We receive only purchase/entitlement status needed to unlock Pro features. We do not receive your payment card details.</p>
<p>For payment issues or refunds, please use Google Play’s purchase and refund processes.</p>

<h2>Sensitive information</h2>
<p>Prompt Wizard is a text utility. Avoid storing passwords, one-time codes (OTPs), or other highly sensitive information in Memory Boxes or exports.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Your content is stored and processed locally. Your device’s security (screen lock, encryption, backups) is controlled by Android and your device settings.</p>
<p>Prompt Wizard enables screenshot protection by default (to reduce accidental capture of on-screen content). You can turn this off in Settings.</p>

<h2>Android backups and device migration</h2>
<p>Depending on your Android settings, your device may back up and restore some app data (for example during device migration or reinstall). If enabled, Android may back up app data to your Google account (for example, Google Drive) as part of device backup. This is controlled by Android and your Google account/device settings, not by us.</p>

<h2>Your choices and controls</h2>
<ul>
	<li>You can edit or delete Memory Boxes in the app.</li>
	<li>You can remove app data from the device by uninstalling the app. If you have device backups enabled, Android may restore some app data when reinstalling.</li>
	<li>You can also remove app data using Android settings (for example, “Clear storage/clear data”).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Retention</h2>
<p>App content is retained locally on your device until you delete it, clear app data, or uninstall.</p>
<p>Support emails are kept as long as needed to respond and maintain support records.</p>
<p>If you want us to delete a support email you sent, contact us at <a href="mailto:promptwizard@archersteplabs.com">promptwizard@archersteplabs.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Children</h2>
<p>Prompt Wizard is not directed to children under 13.</p>

<h2>International processing (support email)</h2>
<p>If you contact support by email, your message may be processed and stored by email service providers in different countries, depending on your email provider and ours.</p>

<h2>Complaints</h2>
<p>You may have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.</p>

<h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
<p>If we make material changes, we will post the updated policy on this page with a new “Last updated” date.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>

<p><strong>Security issues:</strong> please email <a href="mailto:promptwizard@archersteplabs.com">promptwizard@archersteplabs.com</a> with the subject “Security”.</p>
